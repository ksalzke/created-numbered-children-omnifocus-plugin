# Actions

## Create Numbered Children

This action can be run on one or more selected tasks. 

It shows a form prompting the user for the number of child tasks to be created, and then creates that amount of numbered task.

For example, if the task `Do something` is selected and '4' is selected, the resultant tasks will look like this:

 - Do something
   - 1
   - 2
   - 3
   - 4
